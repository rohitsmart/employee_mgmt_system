# Employee Management System
  This project allows candidates to view all job postings and apply directly. Once HR selects a candidate's resume, an exam will be conducted based on rounds. In this project, HR has the authority to perform all job-related operations, and the admin can change a candidate's role to employee. Each employee has their own responsibilities.
